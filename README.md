# 👾 About Me — Ayush Edition

Hey there! I'm Ayush — people call me that even when I tell them not to... but it's fine, I've accepted my destiny.

🏃‍♂️ Ex-athlete turned game dev — I used to run on tracks, now I run away from bugs in Unity.  
💻 Currently making games, breaking code, fixing code, and then breaking it again — it's an art form.  
🛠️ I write small programs that somehow make big things explode in games. Not in real life. (Yet.)

## 💬 Fun Facts (or... Tragic Truths)

- 💪 I once bench-pressed more than my game’s framerate.
- 🎮 I design games for fun and accidentally rage-test them myself.
- 🐛 My relationship with bugs is... complicated. We meet often.
- 🚀 “It works on my machine” — me, 3 AM, seconds before disaster.
- 🎨 I’m not saying I’m good at game design, but my mom clapped when I showed her a cube rotating.

## 📢 Currently

- Making an FPS game with drone attacks that’ll make you question your reflexes.
- Hoping Unity won’t crash before I press Ctrl+S.
- Drinking more coffee than the Unity Editor consumes RAM.
